# VideoLib-CLI Dependencies
# CLI application requirements

# Core library (install from GitHub)
videolib @ git+https://github.com/BrianAtCode/videolib.git

# If you want to use a local videolib for development:
# pip install -e ../videolib

# Or if videolib is published to PyPI:
# videolib>=1.0.0

# Note: FFmpeg and yt-dlp are already included in videolib dependencies
# No additional packages needed for basic CLI functionality
